# Loan Approval Assessment using Machine Learning

### Introduction

Loan approval prediction refers to the use of machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a loan application being approved or denied by banks and financial institutions. By using advanced algorithms and predictive models, banks can streamline their loan approval processes and make informed decisions for the benefit of both lenders and borrowers.

The dataset includes various details about loan seekers including their personal and financial information, such as gender, marital status, education level, income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, property size and loan approval status.
